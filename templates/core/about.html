                    <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    <p>Shiny Quiz was created as a modern, user-friendly alternative to traditional quiz platforms. Built with Django 5.2, our application leverages the latest web technologies to provide a seamless experience for quiz takers and creators alike.</p>
                    
                    <p>The project began as an exploration of Django's capabilities and has evolved into a full-featured quiz platform with social login integration, customizable themes, and a responsive design that works on any device.</p>
