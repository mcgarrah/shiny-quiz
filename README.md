# Shiny Quiz

Shiny Quiz Web App using Django

My goal is to build a **Shiny New Quiz Web App** using Django with its very opinionated framework to accelerate the development. I have built the [Legendary Quick Quiz](https://github.com/mcgarrah/legendary_quick_quiz) using the Python Flask framework as an exercise to refresh my skills in that framework.

## Technical Requirements

* use Django 5.1/5.2 depending on release timeline for 5.2
* evaluating Bootstrap v5 vs Tailwind CSS
* current Python runtime version 3.13.x
* easy managed deployment with `Procfile`, `runtime.txt`
* use `pip3` or `poetry` for `requirements.txt`

## Misc notes

* [Django Easy Quiz](https://gitlab.com/kapt/open-source/django-easy-quiz) module by Tom Walker with [pip3 link](https://pypi.org/project/django-quiz-app/).
* [Configurable quiz app for Django](https://github.com/tomwalker/django_quiz) that is over 7 years old but has great requirements list
* [Django app for quizzes for Azure](https://github.com/pamelafox/django-quiz-app) that is more recent and worth reviewing
* [Create a quiz app with HTMX and Django in 8 mins](https://tomdekan.com/articles/quiz-htmx) by Tom Dekan Published: March 5, 2024
